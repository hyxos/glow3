# Glow³

**Scalar field and color-mapping visualizations on high-dimensional surfaces.**

---

## Status

_This is a planned subproject of the [Shard³](https://github.com/hyxos/shard3) ecosystem.  
Glow³ is not yet in active development._

---

## Overview

Glow³ will enable the visualization of scalar fields, gradients, and color-mapped data on complex geometric structures. The project will leverage Hyxos Media’s modular framework.

If you would like to be notified when Glow³ development begins, please watch this repository or join the conversation in the [Shard³ metaproject](https://github.com/hyxos/shard3/discussions).
